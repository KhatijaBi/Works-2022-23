human intelligence inside computer is ai
making machines to learn like humans is ml
-supervised -learning from someone
it has features and labels
regression and classification algos
regression=1,2,3,4,5(continuous data prediction)

classification=(yes/no),(true/false),(male/female),(infected/defected)
-unsupervised - learning on own

-reimforcement learning- rewards and penalties

classification
-linear regression
-logistic regression
-decision tree
-random forest
-svm(support vector machine)
-KNN(k nearest neigbours)
-Naive bayes

Features= input =x
Labels= y output
Model= y=2x(what u build from input+output)=(equation)(function)(program)
x=1 y=3 , x=2 y=6 equation is y=3x
regular computer program= give input and get output
machine learning program= give input n output derive program

PPDD - predictive analysis(seeing past data and analysing future)-ML is predictive analysis.
prescriptive analysis (problem prescription)
descriptive analysis (describing problem)
diagnosis analysis (diagonising problem)\

Libraries used in machine learning
Numpy (python number processing library)
Scipy(python  scientific library)
Matplotlib (plotting)
Pandas(subset of sql and database)
Scikit Learn(Library which has all machine learning algos)

steps involved in ML programming
1. Get/Collect Data -(Kaggle)
x=1,3,5,7,8
y=2,6,10,14,16
2. Identify Algorithm -regression,classification
x 40 50 60 20 10
y 1 1 1 0

Building an mathematical equation btw input and output is ML or DL.


3.  Every ml has 3 methods
   Fit - build model by taking input and output
   Predict -it will input and predict output depending on the equation we have built.
   Score - used for prediction accuracy.
